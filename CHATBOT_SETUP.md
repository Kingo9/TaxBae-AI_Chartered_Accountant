## 🧪 Testing Guide

### **Phase 1: Basic Functionality**

1. **Launch the app** and navigate to the "Chat" tab
2. **Initial Load**: Should show "Initializing your AI assistant..." then display welcome message
3. **Quick Suggestions**: Tap any suggestion button - should auto-send and get AI response
4. **Manual Input**: Type a question and send - should get personalized response

### **Phase 2: RAG Functionality Testing**

Test these specific queries to verify RAG is working:

#### 🏛️ **Tax Knowledge Retrieval**
```
"Tell me about Section 80C deductions"
"What are the limits for 80D health insurance?"
"How does the new tax regime work?"
"When is the ITR filing deadline?"
```
**Expected**: Detailed, accurate responses with specific amounts, dates, and sections.

#### 📊 **User Data Integration**
```
"Based on my expenses, what can I save tax on?"
"Analyze my spending patterns"
"Suggest investments based on my financial data"
"What's my current tax saving potential?"
```
**Expected**: Responses referencing your actual transaction data, spending categories, and personalized recommendations.

### **Phase 3: Session Management**

1. **Send multiple messages** - conversation should maintain context
2. **Close and reopen app** - should restore previous conversation
3. **Send new message** - should continue in same session
4. **Long conversations** - should handle 10+ message exchanges smoothly

### **Phase 4: Error Handling**

1. **No OpenAI Key**: Should show "AI service unavailable" message
2. **Network Issues**: Should handle gracefully with retry options
3. **Invalid Queries**: Should provide helpful guidance

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### **Customizing the AI Personality**

Edit `backend/src/services/aiChatbotService.ts`, line 216:
```typescript
private createSystemPrompt(taxContext: string, userContext: string): string {
    return `You are TaxBae AI, an expert Indian tax advisor...
    
    // Customize this prompt to change AI behavior
    `;
}
```

### **Adding More Tax Knowledge**

Edit the `taxKnowledgeBase` object in `aiChatbotService.ts`:
```typescript
this.taxKnowledgeBase = {
  sections: {
    '80C': 'Your content here...',
    // Add new sections
    '80CCC': 'Pension fund contributions...',
  }
};
```

### **Extending RAG Context**

The `getUserContext()` method retrieves:
- Recent transactions
- Spending patterns
- Tax-saving investments

Extend this in `aiChatbotService.ts` to include more user data.
